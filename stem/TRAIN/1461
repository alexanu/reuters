International Business Machines Corp said demonstrated experimental computer chip called opto-electronic receiver transforms light electrical signal translate computer language .
IBM said chip two time faster similar chip reported read 40 encyclopedia volume second .
The chip made gallium arsenide move electrical signal faster silicon used computer circuit .
IBM also said since gallium arsenide efficient turning light signal electrical signal , seems ideal material light-based computer communication expected widely used future .
The chip 's speed also enhanced elimination wiring placing functionally dissimilar photodetector transistor circuitry close together .
Bringing element closer together also isolates receiver electronic circuit reduces noise distortion , said .
