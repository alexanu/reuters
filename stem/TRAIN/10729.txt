The complex task wielding control monetary policy increasingly fast-moving global economy could aided tying policy commodity price , newest member Federal Reserve Board say .
Commodity price already considered Fed making monetary policy .
But would given much greater role idea floated Governor Robert Heller , joined board last August .
He conceeds much study idea needed , argues arrangement , particularly adopted major industrial country , could reduce volatility exchange rate .
Moreover , could help stabilize price commodity , slowing change inflation .
His idea , many conservative economist find appealing , backing among board member appointed recent year President Reagan .
It would complement present system opening closing monetary screw based pattern inflation , key indicator unemployment , rise fall money supply .
Changes money supply lead change interest rate affect economic activity directly .
Discussed long time , commodity concept part growing search system anchor monetary policy widely-fluxtuating currency price solid base .
`` What needed anchor reference point serve guide domestic international monetary purpose , '' say Heller .
In past , anchor gold United States went gold standard global economy vastly outstripped gold supply .
A return gold standard generally dismissed hand policymakers ground largest producer gold Soviet Union South Africa .
The so-called fixed rate system , scuttled early 1970s , still considered unworkable present world .
But current system floating currency currency fluxtuate widely , adding vast pressure monetary system , also widely questioned .
Some suggested system might benefit formal approach mandate intervention country currency wander agreed level major problem also .
For one thing , justifiable concern country might relunctant intervene felt might detrimental domestic economy .
Moreover , question whether concerted intervention make much inpact overall market agree fundamental judgement .
The poorest country called monetary conference work new system , surprisingly , help cope overpowering debt problem .
Treasury Secretary James Baker , Reagan administration's chief economic architect , preferred use so-called Group Five industrial country sometimes , Seven , forum work cooperative agreement currency economic matter .
He appears convinced official West Germany , France , Britain , Japan , Italy Canada talking quietly behind closed door reached reasoned decision away public posturing .
The Heller approach , extremely complex , could profound impact system , ideally stabalizing price international exchange rate .
As envisioned Heller , basket say , 30 major commodity ranging wheat oil , would put together price would measured regular basis .
`` In time rising commodity price , monetary policy might tightened time falling commodity price , montary policy might eased , '' say .
He note commodity price traded daily auction market , commodity price index calculated virtually continuous basis .
Moreover , commodity price produced , consumed traded world-wide basis , `` index relevance entire world , '' say .
In addition , commodity price beginning production chain serve imput virtually production process .
`` Focusing commodity price early sensitive indicator current perhaps also future price pressure , monetary authority may take index account making monetary policy decision , '' say .
However , say major change basic commodity occurred oil 1970s action OPEC cartel , would discounted system .
He say worst thing could happen allow monetary policy spread freakish increase one commodity rest system commodity .
