Soviet winter grain could faulty start spring enduring usually dry fall cold winter , weather crop analyst said .
Prospects another near-record grain harvest Soviet Union appear dim point , premature forecast major crop problem , analyst said .
But situation bear careful watching next six week ultimately impact Soviet grain supply future buying plan , analyst Soviet Union said .
`` From weather standpoint , say certainty Soviets getting good start lower crop ( last year ) , '' Gail Martell , chief meteorologist E.F. Hutton said .
The next six week USSR 's grain growing area crucial period determine final outcome winter crop , Martell analyst said .
`` Where crop really made broken still ahead u , '' Agriculture Department authority USSR said .
The Soviet Union recently reported nine mln hectare winter grain reseeded due winterkill .
This would equal 25 pct total winter crop would second highest winterkill ten year , USDA analyst said .
With timely spring , Soviet farmer would probably able reseed damaged acreage spring crop , analyst noted spring crop normally yield lower winter crop -- sometimes much 30-35 pct lower .
Normally winterkill caused inadequate snowcover combined cold temperature .
This winter , however , snowcover Soviet grain area generally excellent , bulk winterkill , analyst speculate , likely due dry fall subsequent poor crop germination .
`` Fall dryness may problem .
There 's good correlation mediocre crop fall dryness , '' Martell said .
Precipitation last fall little 25 pct normal southern northern Ukraine , normal entire winter crop area , said .
Recent cold temperature grain area snowcover gradually melting could also caused problem ice-crusting winterkill , Jim Candor , senior forecaster Accu Weather , said .
Livestock feed need probably increased fall winter , analyst said .
The dry fall damaged pasture , cold winter raised feed demand late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding , said .
`` The Soviets desperate situation ... n't buy ( grain ) , '' USDA official said .
But Soviets worried winter crop feel last year 's huge crop 210 mln tonne one-time fluke brought perfect condition , Soviet buying might occur insure crop supply , said .
Bad weather next six week could push Soviets back market , weather analyst said .
`` A lot winterkill could occur next month half , '' Martell said .
