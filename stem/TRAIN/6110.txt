Latin American sugar producer awaiting rise world market price moving boost production , official trade source said .
Although price risen around eight five U.S .
Cents per lb past six month , still region 's nine ten cent per lb average production cost .
The recent rise price placed producer alert , Manuel Rico , consultant Group Latin American Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries ( GEPLACEA ) , told Reuters .
However , Rico said , would require another five seven cent stimulate notable increase output .
`` Producers taking measure increasing production price profitable , '' said .
Officials Mexico , Guatemala Ecuador said continued rise price would stimulate production , industry leader Panama Costa Rica said still long way go .
`` The price ridiculous , '' said Julian Mateo , vice president Costa Rica 's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League .
`` At current price nobody going consider increasing production .
'' Other producer wary committing fund increasing output , given instability world market .
An official Colombia 's National Association Sugar Cane Growers said plan raise export target .
`` The market unstable .
What happening yet giving way pattern reason modify anything .
'' In 1985 , latest year full figure available , Central South American nation produced 28 mln tonne , raw value , sugar 12.3 mln exported .
A year earlier , produced exported 800,000 , according London-based International Sugar Organization .
Years continuous low price plunged sugar industry many country region recession hard recover .
Miguel Guerrero , director Dominican Republic's National Sugar Institute , said would difficult boost production even price recovered sharply .
Output slumped 450,000 tonne year 900,000 late 1970s .
Obsolete refinery , poor transport badly maintained plantation barrier short term recovery output , added .
Plans nearby Cuba , world 's largest cane sugar exporter , increase output 10 mln tonne year end decade seem ambitious , trade source said .
Output running well record 8.6 mln produced 1970 .
Cuba suffers run plantation , harvesting problem poor processing facility low world price , since much output sold Eastern Bloc country special deal .
Last year , bad weather added trouble , output fell 7.2 mln tonne 8.2 mln 1985 .
The low world price recent year led many country region cut exportable production level barely cover U.S. And , case Caribbean country , European Community ( EC ) import quota , receive price well free market level .
Progressive reduction U.S. Quotas led production stagnating falling rather shifted free world market .
Peru , example , shipped 96,000 tonne U.S .
In 1983 1984 .
This fell 76,000 1986 year quota 37,000 .
A national cooperative official said , long world market level continue around half Peru 's production cost , future industry uncertain .
At meeting GEPLACEA Brazil last October official stressed need find alternative us sugar cane , according group 's executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre , `` grows like weed '' throughout region .
Brazil , largest cane producer output around 240 mln tonne , us half produce alcohol fuel .
Cane excess internal demand alcohol sugar refined sugar sale abroad earn much needed foreign currency .
The difference price state-run Sugar Alcohol Institute ( IAA ) pay local industry receives foreign buyer cost government 350 mln dlrs year .
Soaring domestic demand alcohol sugar past year , coupled drought-reduced cane crop , meant Brazil difficulty meeting export commitment 1987 , trade source said .
Negotiations delay shipment next year indecisive far , main sticking point Brazil compensate buyer non-delivery sugar sold around five cent per lb would cost eight cent replace .
Brazilian sugar industry source said new sugar export sale expected extremely low next year , Institute wary exposing domestic shortage either alcohol sugar need rebuild depleted reserve stockpile .
However , situation could change dramatically economy go recession internal demand slump .
Sources within Latin America Caribbean hold little hope region 's sugar industry return profitability unless U.S. And EC change policy .
`` The agricultural policy European Community United States caused economy incalculable harm closing market , price deterioration international commerce furthermore unfair competition third country , '' Brazil 's Trade Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told October GEPLACEA meeting .
The EC come prolonged attack GEPLACEA group charge continued dumping excess output world market .
GEPLACEA official say main cause low price .
GEPLACEA see new International Sugar Agreement would regulate price one chance pulling region 's industry steady decline .
Such agreement would U.S. And EC backing industrialised country would see political rather merely economic pact .
`` They realise economy suffer , le capcity buy good repay region 's 360 billion dollar foreign debt , '' GEPLACEA 's Latorre said .
