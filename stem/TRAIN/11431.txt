Officials Toshiba & lt ; TSBA.T > told reporter developed kind wire conduct electricity resistance therefore loss power .
Although firm developed superconductive material , Toshiba scientist said discovery first allows material formed pliable wire .
Developing superconducting material work room temperature resistance object frenetic worldwide scientific race .
The main application would super powerful magnet , small computer immense power speed , electric transmission line use negligible power , electric generator consume power .
Toshiba said probably five year incorporate superconductors marketable machine .
But problem still surmounted .
Present superconductors , including Toshiba 's , need cooled low temperature pas electricity resistance .
This requires costly liguid gas coolant .
Superconductors developed date transmit small current conduct alternating current , direct current , government scientist said .
Toshiba , spent 190.3 billion yen research development year ended March 31 1986 , count among leading superconductor research company Japan , manager Toshiba 's public relation Yuji Wakayama said.. The wire company us blend yttrium , barium copper oxide conduct resistance minus 179.5 degree centigrade .
