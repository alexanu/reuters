Research material conduct electricity minimal resistance could lead gain Tokyo 's booming stock market , broker said .
They said share price company likely benefit so-called 'superconductors ' rose sharply last week publication article research economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun .
The company non-ferrous metal , electrical mining sector .
But industry analyst said development problem remain commercial application still year away .
`` The area clearly significant application won't commercially viable year , '' said Thomas Murtha , technology analyst James Capel Co. Industry analyst said use superconductors could bring sharp cut electricity cost present problem overcome .
Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said superconductors could application computer circuitry , electricity generation storage , scientific research .
The superconductors made blend metal fused heat-firing process similar used ceramic .
Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp & lt ; KAWS.T > predicted in-house study 1990 worldwide market would worth 150 billion yen superconductors used computer , 50 billion used electricity generator 150 billion used electricity storage .
The study said 1995 would train capable 500 km hour , hovering magnetic field powered mainly superconductors .
One hundred billion yen worth superconducting material would needed train .
The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would used nuclear fusion physic , year 2000 .
Industry analyst said superconductors commercial application present .
In laboratory test conductor must cooled expensive liquid helium hydrogen minimum electrical resistance achieved , though liquid nitrogen , much le expensive , recently also used successfully , said .
Despite , investor Tokyo 's stock market boosted share firm related superconducting material .
From close trading March 17 yesterday's close , Mitsubishi Mining Cement Co Ltd 's & lt ; MIMI.T > share price rose 140 yen 485 yen .
In period Mitsubishi Metal Corp & lt ; MITM.T > , rose 95 745 yen , Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd & lt ; TOMM.T > rose 200 1440 yen , Kawasaki Steel rose 15 260 .
Furukawa Electric Co Ltd share & lt ; URUT.T > jumped 104 yen 689 yen , Fuji Electric Co Ltd & lt ; FUJE.T > rose 141 619 .
Brokers said share supplier scientific instrument needed conduct superconductor research also rose .
Industry analyst said favoured superconductor , made blend yttrium , barium copper , currently undergoing laboratory test scheme coordinated Ministry International Trade Industry ( MITI ) .
