Grain analyst meteorologist Gail Martell , author EF Hutton publication `` Global Crop News , '' said latest report Soviets may import grain , possibly wheat , U.S. due potential crop damage .
`` Compared last year , outlook ( Soviet winter grain crop ) far pessimistic , '' said .
`` But 's still early talk disastrous loss .
A lot depend spring weather , outcome troubled winter grain crop , also spring planting .
'' Martell said dry weather condition last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination winter grain .
Key wheat growing area southern Ukraine North Caucasus received 25-35 pct autumn precipitation , said .
The bitter winter cold temperature -- broke record low stood four decade -- also may taken toll Soviet winter crop , said .

Martell also skeptical Soviet claim 1986 grain harvest 210 mln tonne , said Chernobyl accident may contaminated grain originally thought made import .
However , said U.S. remains supplier last resort Soviet Union , noting Soviets recently begun first U.S. grain purchase 1986/87 season buying 2.25 mln tonne corn .
Martell cited USDA statistic showing since 1980 grain embargo U.S. major supplier grain USSR year heavy Soviet demand .
In 1984/85 , U.S. supplied 41 pct record Soviet grain import 55.5 mln tonne .
But 1985/86 , Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonne grain turned U.S. 24 pct total .
While USDA Soviet import target grain 1986/87 22 mln tonne , many U.S. grain analyst revised estimate Soviet import 25-28 mln tonne , said .
