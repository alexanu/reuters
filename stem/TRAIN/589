U.S. semiconductor manufacturer , struggling stem river red ink , increasingly looking toward customized design rather mass-market chip future profit .
The market customized chip - semiconductor designed specific application product - expected expand 25 30 pct year , compared six pct entire integrated circuit industry .
Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimate sale customized chip totaled 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last year , 12 pct total chip market .
By 1990 , however , customized chip expected represent 12 billion 15 billion dlr market , 25 pct total chip sale .
More important vendor , standard design customized chip represent seller ' market , price profit margin set accordingly .
High volume memory chip become `` perfect commodity market , '' Robert Brodersen , professor electrical engineering University California Berkeley , told industry forum .
`` The product interchangeable one manufacturer another customer base buying decision almost entirely price , '' Brodersen said .
He predicted , next year , handful world 's largest chip manufacturer ( Japanese ) produce memory chip , standard electronic component found everything digital watch computer .
`` The rest industry wo n't involved .
'' Last week 's International Solid State Circuits Conference , chip industry 's annual forum new development , seemed support Brodersen 's prediction .
Of 116 paper presented conference , 40 pct Japanese author , first time outnumberd United States .
Most Japanese chip design memory category , including Nippon Telephone Telegraph Co's attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory ( dram ) chip , 16 time powerful anything available .
The advanced memory chip described U.S. company International Business Machine Corp 's & lt ; IBM > four mln bit chip , IBM manufacture chip internal use , open market .
The problem memory chip based , well known design standard , easy copy inexpensive manufacture .
Because large Japanese conglomerate Sony Corp & lt ; SNE > , NEC Corp , & lt ; NIPNY > Matushita Mitsui enormous consumer electronics product line , also guaranteeed internal market chip , produce huge amount low cost per unit .
Customized chip , however , designed specific customer , manufactured small quantity expensive relative standard chip .
Computer market increasingly looking customized chip difficult copy , thus making final product harder clone well .
Intel Corp & lt ; INTC > , leading manufacturer microprocessor form brain computer , alerted industry intention switch customized chip last fall .
The company , reported loss 1986 , said spend 75 mln dlrs next three year turn leading manufacturer custom semi-custom chip .
Intel join 275 company already competing piece customized chip business advantage others .
IBM , owns 20 pct stake Intel , agreed share design many 15,000 chip make use .
Intel customize design sell others .
It also get use IBM 's proprietary computer system designing chip , considered expert one advanced world .
Intel 's success still guaranteed , however .
Industry analyst noted far different design mass market item customized chip requires close working relationship customer .
Intel spent five year 100 mln dlrs developing newest 30386 microprocessor .
A much faster turnarouond time , much lower development cost , required customized chip firm succeed .
