A 0/92 program would little impact U.S. acreage , prompting farmer idle additional 3.5 mln acre cropland every year , according report Agriculture Department .
The saving resulting additional 3.5 mln acre idled would little 400 mln dlrs loan saving , 35 mln dlrs transportation storage saving , 10-20 mln dlrs per year deficiency payment saving , report said .
The USDA report asssessed impact proposed 0/92 acreage program wheat , corn , cotton , sorghum barley .
Last year , almost 245 mln acre crop harvested .
`` The likelihood 0-92 provisiion cause large acreage removed crop production quite small , '' report said .
`` The return typical farm still favor participation usual acreage reduction program seeding permitted acreage , '' USDA report said .
The 0/92 program , would allow farmer forego planting still receive 92 pct deficiency payment , would used producer high production/high risk area cost production high , said Keith Collins , director USDA 's economics analysis staff .
`` In heart corn belt , would get much participation , '' Collins said .
USDA estimated additional one mln acre wheat would ildled 0/92 , 1.5 mln acre corn , 500,000 acre sorghum barley 500,000 acre cotton .
Production idled acre would equivalent 40 mln bushel wheat , 180 mln bushel corn , 20 mln bushel sorghum , 10 mln bushel barley , 500,000 bale cotton , report said .
`` In determining whether participate , producer would need weigh expected cash cost production loan rate ... The risk market price may rise expected level reduce deficiency payment also must considered , '' according analysis .
`` What 're giving 0/92 difference loan rate cost production , '' Collins said .
For producer low production cost , difference greater applied paying variable cost , said .
Under cicumstances , farmer would want go along 0/92 .
But high cost producer , 0/92 would attractive .
Also , loan rate get lower , Collins said would incentive participate 0/92 program .
`` I would admit impact would marginal first , step towards goal separating production decision government payment , '' Collins said .
In speech earlier today National Grains Feed Association , USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said late implement 0/92 1987 crop since program signup end month .
