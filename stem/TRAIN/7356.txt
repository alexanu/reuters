Higher crude oil price raise demand natural gas , helping reclaim market share lost heavy oil price plunged 1986 , analyst said .
The analyst said effort successful industrial sector economy large growing energy requirement .
`` Natural gas stand good chance recapture share oil supplied electric utility lost residual fuel industry last year , '' Michael Smolinski , energy economist Data Resources Inc , told Reuters .
An estimated 200,000 barrel per day residual fuel went utility market expense natural gas last year world oil price plunged , Smolinski said .
Assuming oil price hold 15 dlrs barrel , national average gas price delivered utility projected 2.10 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would competitive , Michael German , vice president economic analysis American Gas Association said .
The average delivered price end January 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu , compared 3.26 dlrs year ago .
`` We expect natural gas regain 250 400 billion cubic foot ( demand ) overall energy market second third quarter ( 1987 ) , '' said .
In addition price competitiveness , availability important factor persuading energy user switch gas , Frank Spadine , senior energy economist Bankers Trust Corp. New York noted .
Spadine said mild winter many part North American continent led build gas inventory le would necessary replenish underground storage spring freeing gas spot sale .
These forecast develop strong counterpoint fear natural gas suplies would tight price significantly higher given sharp decline drilling last year .
AGA 's German contended despite drilling decline , much U.S. proved reserve could brought production quickly development infill drilling permit well drilled proved reserve basin .
Citing recent EIA statistic , German said , gas surplus likely contract three trillion cubic foot 1986 two trillion cubic foot 1987 , surplus would go away 1990 .
Smolinski Data Resources agreed surplus would persist 1990 .
While gas supply may tighten certain consuming area , notably California Northeast U.S. , overall shortfall appeared remote .
