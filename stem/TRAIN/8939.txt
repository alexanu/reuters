The International Wheat Council ( IWC ) lifted estimate 1986/87 world wheat coarse grain production one mln tonne record 1,377 mln , compared 1,351 mln tonne previous season .
In monthly market report , IWC said leaving unchanged forecast world wheat production coming 1987/88 season 520 530 mln tonne record 534 mln 1986/87 .
The one mln tonne upward revision 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustment .
The IWC raised 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln 87 mln tonne .
It left wheat trade unchanged 86 mln .
The IWC 1986/87 estimate world trade wheat coarse grain thus estimated two mln tonne higher 173 mln 169 mln previous season forecast three mln rise Soviet import offset small reduction elsewhere .
The IWC said area harvested wheat 1987/88 likely last year low world price restrictive national policy measure begin take effect .
At least four five major exporter expect see drop wheat sowings without offset country .
There still potential even higher average wheat yield IWC said increasing sign world output may level .
Although still early ass coarse grain outlook , IWC said barley acreage likely fall European Community increase Canada .
U.S. Maize area expected lower oat sowings could rise .
After damage maize crop last year , Soviet Union plan expand area much 50 pct six mln hectare year many frost damaged wheat field likely resown spring crop .
Improved weather increase use intensive cultivation method could therefore see marked rise Soviet maize output 1987 , IWC said .
Any reduction world coarse grain output would bolstered large carryover stock 1986/87 , IWC said .
It left estimate wheat coarse grain stock end & # 127 ; different marketing year unchanged 178 210 mln tonne , respectively , 160 167 mln year earlier .
After record world durum wheat production 218.8 mln tonne last season , IWC said already sign another large crop coming season higher output expected EC , Canada , U.S. And North Africa .
