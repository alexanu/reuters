General Electric Co said researcher investigate potential gas turbine powered combustion gas burning coal .
The company said research part five-year , 19.1 mln dlr program supported U.S. Energy Department's Morgantown Energy Technology Center .
The center expected put 15 mln dlrs cost GE contributes equipment service valued 2.0 mln dlrs , New York State contributes 1.1 mln dlrs Norfolk Southern Corp & lt ; NSC > adding 1.0 mln dlrs .
Rather using conventional gas turbine fuel , distillate oil natural gas , GE said , program look feasability powering turbine coal/water slurry -- mixture water finely ground coal particle ash removed .
Besides using cheaper fuel , company said , system would also le expensive build conventional coal plant require boiler coal heat water make steam drive turbine coal gasifier convert coal gas , burned power turbine .
