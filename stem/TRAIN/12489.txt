Japan attempting cut back semiconductor production forstall 300 mln dlrs U.S. tariff Japanese electronic good set take effect April 17 , industry analyst said .
The move likely create sharp price rise possible shortage key computer component next week , analyst said .
`` Prices gone memory component , mainstay Japanese semiconductor industry , '' analyst Drew Peck Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette said .
But analyst said price rise slight far , questioned whether Japan would successful forcing Japanese company cut production long run .
Others , however , optimistic , saying evidence already hand Japan cut back prodution halted sale grey market , third country broker sell chip production cost .
`` We 've seen grey market begin dry D-RAMS , virtually dried EPROMS , '' said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack two key memory chip used computer .
`` Prices inching lead time delivery stretching , '' Kurlack added .
Industry analyst said Japan 's Ministry International Trade Industry , MITI , requested cut back production meet term last year 's semiconductor accord U.S .
The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariff Japanese electronic good , alleging Japan failed live accord continued dump computer component U.S. market .
But analyst said Japan 's attempt mollify U.S. double edged sword , might read subtle form trade retaliation tariff proposed U.S. As production Japan cut , analyst argue , price rise U.S. American semiconductor manufacture able take slack since long ago exited market memory chip .
U.S. computer maker use chip machine pressured .
`` The Japanese looking way reduce trade pressure Washington , time they're demonstating muscle , '' analyst Peck said .
The cut back Japanese production expected benefit U.S. chip maker .
`` I think could important factor U.S. semiconductor manufacturer , '' industry analyst Elliot Levine Ladenburg Thalmann Co said .
But analyst Peck said , `` take week see whether Japan genuinely cut production .
'' He said Japanese manufacture likely view MITI's request unfavorably chip capacity still high production cut back would lead significant write-off plant equipment .
