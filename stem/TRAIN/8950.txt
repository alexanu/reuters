Efforts government control wheat surplus cutting support price met partial success , International Wheat Council ( IWC ) say latest monthly report .
Faster result could achieved policy reducing price area , employed United States , IWC say survey support price five main wheat exporter - Argentina , Australia , Canada , EC U.S .
In country , example Australia Argentina , highly dependent wheat shipment export income , may problem reducing production .
A policy cutting wheat production could lead unemployment , job prospect outside agriculture limited .
Alternative crop may offer inferior return could lead lost export revenue balance payment problem .
The IWC outline three course action open government wheat exporting country .
They could continue support price hope world economy improves demand wheat rise surplus wil reduced eliminated .
Alternatively , support could limited wheat could easily sold , without needing stored long period .
This option may prove politically unattractive would result many producer abandoning wheat production , report said .
The third option would government distinguish commercial social aspect agriculture , possibly varying support price according farm size overall production .
The IWC review cover support price major exporting country since 1982 .
At time period producer cut support price response growing surplus .
These change always result lower export subsidy several occasion currency fluctuation offset lower price domestic currency .
For example 1985/86 1986/87 EC intervention price bread wheat fell 209.30 179.44 European currency unit ( Ecus ) .
It dollar term , currency export transaction denominated , intervention price however rose 193 dlrs 168 .
The high cost supporting farm price put strain national exchequer government searching way cut expenditure , report say .
The proportion world wheat output produced five major exporter declined period covered survey 40 pct 1982 35 pct 1987 .
This partly due increased production China India .
The period saw upward trend yield , although countered Argentina , U.S. And Australia lower acreage .
In Argentina reduction sown area 20 per cent put low price causing producer switch enterprise , particularly livestock lower U.S. Acreages attributed official incentive .
