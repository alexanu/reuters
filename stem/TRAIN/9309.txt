International Business Machines Corp said scientist Zurich research laboratory taken key step toward developing method testing computer chip laser .
The technique important , IBM said , could lead development tool determine quality microscopic-sized computer chip without damaging .
IBM said chip maker need advanced testing method aid developing next generation semiconductor .
These chip smaller today 's chip able store vastly greater amount information .
IBM said technique us laser light `` contactless '' measuring electrical signal metal line similar kind found computer chip circuitry .
It said using commercially available laser , method permit measurement circuit width one micrometer le .
A micrometer 80 time smaller thickness sheet paper .
