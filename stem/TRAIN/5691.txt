Surprisingly strong U.S. housing statistic February taken indication economy generating momentum sufficient cause start lifting forecast first quarter growth , economist said .
Building boosted two factor last month , unusually mild weather low mortgage rate .
But economist said seasonal factor make hard ass spur economy , , come housing coming month .
And steady retreat , mortgage rate seem near bottom .
U.S. housing start rose 2.6 pct February seasonally adjusted annual rate 1.851 mln unit 1.804 mln January .
It highest pace start since April 1986 .
The rate permit issued future building climbed 4.4 pct seasonally adjusted annual rate 1.764 mln unit dropping 11.52 pct 1.690 mln January .
`` February 's weather usually adverse home building .
Because seasonal factor 's difficult determine mean economy road , '' said Allan Leslie Discount Corp .
The housing report seasonally-weighted compensate weather-related setback .
As result , milder temperature inflate statistic .
Economists said low mortgage rate also spur building last month .
But several believe rate consolidate edging late spring/early summer .
`` Builders looking current mortgage rate saying 'Let 's ' , '' said Mark Obrinsky U.S. League Savings Institutions Washington , whose member supply much financing home building .
But Obrinsky doubt much downward potential rate foresees higher inflation overall improvement U.S. economy .
He expects rate gain 50 100 basis point early summer 9.50 pct fixed rate effective February .
Last November , fixed rate mortgage 10.30 pct .
As expected , strength housing concentrated single-family sector .
The multi-family area -- typically represents rental unit -- remained weak due high vacancy rate increased capital cost unit following tax law change effective January 1 .
Single-family start rose 5.6 pct annual pace 1.317 mln unit .
Multi-family fell 4.1 pct 534,000 rate .
`` Strength single-family sector indicates low mortgage rate job .
But 're probably looking great deal growth potential , '' said Ward McCarthy Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
McCarthy noted housing report , together larger expected gain U.S. employment , industrial output retail sale February , may cause observer start waving `` four pct GNP banner '' first quarter .
Gross national product grew 1.3 pct fourth quarter .
But McCarthy , still expects first quarter real GNP come annual rate 2.5 pct slightly , convinced growth pick future .
`` The big story inventory re-building 's going , intentional , '' said .
For example , U.S. automaker , already saddled high stock , produced annual rate 8.3 mln unit February compared domestic car sale 7.3 mln .
Thus inventory could contribute GNP first quarter , may result scaled-back production weaker growth second , said .
`` If first quarter growth inventory building identify improvement export demand , potential softness second quarter , '' agreed Allan Leslie Discount Corp .
He still evaluating first quarter GNP prospect .
Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week current data show worsening trade reversed .
`` At time pumping inventory first quarter , could foresee production slowing second , '' cautioned Joe Plocek McCarthy , Crisanti Maffei Inc , expects first quarter growth three pct .
