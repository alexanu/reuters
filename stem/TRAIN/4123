Arrivals start pick sharply pod current flowering gathered .
However , source noted late temporao always susceptible pod rot , flourish condition turn cold humid , likely late July .
This year 's crop doubly susceptible poor price mean farmer encouraged invest fertiliser insecticide also unlikely treat pod rot .
A severe attack pod rot cause loss 500,000 bag short period , one source said .
Because increased exposure pod rot damage , estimate final outcome temporao extremely vulnerable production could easily drop 2.0 mln bag mark disease hit .
Although flowering good following start rain , pod setting expectation , possibly drought caused drop insect population pollinates flower , source said .
