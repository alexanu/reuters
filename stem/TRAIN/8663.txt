A leading U.S. farm-state Congressman , Jerry Huckaby , D-La. , warned press next year legislation control domestic production sweetener , perhaps including corn sweetener , industry fails voluntarily halt output increase year .
`` We 're moving toward direction could self-destruct ( U.S. sugar program ) , '' Rep. Huckaby , chairman House agriculture subcommittee dealing sugar issue , told Reuters interview .

He also said soon talk corn refiner subject .
Huckaby said campaign urge halt domestic sweetener output increase effort forestall cut sugar import quota , one mln short ton .
`` I think 're talking dropping ( quota ) another half mln ton , let say , 're getting point program might work , '' said .
`` Ideally , I 'd like freeze thing right , '' said Huckaby , leading advocate sugar grower Congress .
A freeze would mean domestic sugar production current level 6.5 mln ton , corn sweetener share U.S. market staying 50 pct , U.S sugar import holding 1.2 mln ton , Huckaby said .
A decision whether seek legislation made 1987 output number known late year , said .
`` I feel like n't expand production , could probably hold indefinitely , least 1985 farm bill without change ( sugar program ) , '' Huckaby said .
However , much depends whether high-fructose corn syrup producer continue expand share U.S. sweetener market 50 pct , Huckaby said .
He noted estimate corn sweetener capture another 10 pct sweetener market U.S .
But said economic breakthrough production new crystalline corn sweetener expanded corn sweetener share , U.S. sugar import might eliminated U.S. sugar output severely reduced .

Staley Archer Daniels Midland soon .
`` This program advantageous corn user .
They natural , legitimate self-interest seeing program preserved , '' Huckaby said .

Asked would proceed production control without support corn refiner , Huckaby said `` You build fragile house way .
'' Huckaby said understands U.S. cane beet farmer expanded production , high sugar price support mean return sugar higher competing crop soybean grain .
But said sugar grower whole , expansion would good policy .
Huckaby said tried stress , speech sugar industry group , grower continue expand , may penalized retroactively production control legislation passed next year .
Huckaby said Congress unlikely approve change sugar program year despite Reagan administration proposal drastically slash program .
`` The administration proposal drastic , I don't think get head steam , '' Huckaby said .
