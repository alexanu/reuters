Drilling oil California likely continue last year 's sharply reduced level despite recent gain crude oil price , industry analyst said .
Because much crude oil California field thick , heavy expensive extract , oil price would increase near 1985 's level significant recovery seen drilling , said .
`` Companies probably drill best prospect , '' said John Curti , analyst Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new well drilled .
Only 33 rig , one-quarter total available , drilling oil onshore California last week , compared 70 last year , said Bill Bolster Munger Oil Information Services , track California drilling activity .
`` It 's dreg right , '' said Bolster state's drilling activity .
Current price enough justify increased drilling , said Ed Malmgreen California Independent Producers Association .
While Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries pact curb production boosted oil price early year , price eventually fell .
Prices California 's marker grade , Line 63 blend , slumped 20 pct last month 14 dlrs high 17 dlrs .
More half California 's oil come stripper well , producing le 10 barrel day , much oil cost 18 25 dlrs barrel extract , Malmgreen said .
`` It 's unusual stripper well cost 18 dlrs , '' Malmgreen said .
Many stripper well along southern California coast produce eight time much water crude oil , inland well frequently require use steam injection spur extraction thick , heavy oil , said .
The outlook future production California clouded lack exploratory drilling , analyst said .
In heart California 's oil patch , Kern County , produce two-thirds state 's oil , exploratory drilling slowed crawl .
Only 55 exploratory well drilled Kern County 1986 , compared 137 1985 , according David Mitchell state energy commission .
So far year five exploratory well drilled .
`` I n't think 'll even get last year , '' Mitchell said .
No pickup exploratory drilling likely rest decade , Mitchell said .
Along fall drilling come decrease number producing well overall production .
Between February October 1986 , number producing oil well California fell 14 pct 43,521 50,000 , said Bill Guerard California Energy Commission .
In line decrease , California 's crude oil output fell 10 pct last year due low oil price expected remain lower level , analyst said .
Between February October 1986 , California 's crude oil production slipped all-time high 1.185 mln barrel per day 1.066 mln bpd , Guerard said .
Total estimated crude oil production California 1986 408 mln bbl , compared 424 mln bbl 1985 405 mln bbl 1983 , according California Department Conservation .
`` Production 1987 probably hold around 1986 level , '' Guerard said .
