The president Japan 's biggest high technology firm , NEC Corp & lt ; NIPN.T > , anything worried , despite growing anti-Japanese protectionism , soaring yen , stagnant world electronics market .
`` The company 's structure developed looking ahead , '' Tadahiro Sekimoto told Reuters interview .
`` We assumed era strong yen , trade friction globalisation would arrive , moved ahead basis .
There 's need change strategy .
'' However , world 's largest manufacturer microchip , tiny silicon wafer brain high technology product , know must keep looking ahead survive .
Hoping build existing strength , NEC turning focus home electronics , area past weakness , Sekimoto said .
NEC want follow corporate slogan `` C C '' ( Computers Communications ) create high level home electronics go beyond mere television video tape recorder , Sekimoto said .
Home electronics accounted eight pct NEC's total 2,334.67 billion yen sale consolidated basis year ended March 31 , 1986 .
Industry analyst say NEC wise target major growth market future , warn company face stiff competition .
`` This market going long time -- product combine personal computer , video display telecommunication network , '' said Salomon Brothers ( Asia ) Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec .
`` But Matsushita ( Electric Industrial Co Ltd ) may first .
'' But Sekimoto argues NEC 's overall strength carry day .
`` Many company top 10 computer microchip telecommunication , none top 10 three .
NEC unique respect , '' said .
To help already high ranking , NEC increase high level offshore production make one multinational Japan 's electronics firm .
The company increase offshore output good sell overseas 50 pct current 25 pct next several year , Sekimoto said .
But firm plan go alone expanding overseas , despite moving last year become joint owner , along France 's Cie de Machines Bull & lt ; BULP.P > , U.S. Firm Honeywell Inc 's & lt ; HON > Information Systems unit .
`` We hope increase share U.S. Market Honeywell tie-up .
But basic strategy take independent autonomous route , '' said Sekimoto .
The company also plan maintain independent line continuing make computer compatible International Business Machines Corp & lt ; IBM > , said .
`` Among Japanese competitor , NEC n't caught software copyright dispute IBM profit market share gradually expanded , '' Sekimoto said .
Once new way linking non-compatible computer perfected , IBM compatibility irrelevant .
`` What matter best hardware , best software best ability meet customer need , '' Sekimoto said .
In fact , NEC , half Japan 's personal computer market , may go court stop competitor selling cheaper machine run NEC software infringe copyright operating system , NEC spokesman said .
While industry analyst give NEC high mark looking ahead , note failed forecasting microchip demand .
Like Japanese chipmakers , firm left serious excess capacity lean year followed boom time .
But two year cutback capital investment sector , Sekimoto think time come boost spending , slightly .
`` We 're going increase production .
But going invest new product development upgrade existing plant , '' said .
Despite NEC 's admitted strength , analyst note company face tough time due stagnant market .
`` NEC excellent worldwide capacity technology , caught downturn may last long time , '' said Salamon 's Ryavec .
The company forecast trouble slash parent net profit 30 billion yen year ending March 31 , 1987 , 43 pct previous year , although sale expected rise eight pct 2,130 billion yen .
Profits improve slightly next year , rising 38 billion yen sale 2,350 billion , said .
