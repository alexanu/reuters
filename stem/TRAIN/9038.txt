Aluminium scrap recovery usage output secondary metal continue rise , said Shearson Lehman Brothers review secondary aluminium market detail cost demand factor .
Although primary smelting cost declined generally recent year , still substantial energy cost saving offered secondary smelter continue make re-melted material increasingly attractive .
It take around 15,000 kilowatt hour ( kwh ) electricity produce one tonne primary aluminium compared around 550 kwh one tonne secondary metal , Shearson said .
On demand side , development automobile packaging bode well secondary aluminium consumption .
Automobile production , although expected fall year , still upward trend continue foreseeable future , addition , use aluminium casting gaining wider acceptance automobile industry , particularly U.S .
In packaging , Shearson expect aluminium dominate beverage market major economy extent U.S. , But say evidence recycling increase country .
In addition cost saving involved , technology advance enable alloy higher purity produced secondary aluminium industry , Shearson said .
There likely problem availability U.S. Has huge scrap reservoir also true several European country , albeit smaller scale .
