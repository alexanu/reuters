Some United States ' largest aerospace firm competing world 's powerful nation chance cash coming commercialization space .
The newest space race contract launch privately owned satellite orbit - business expected worth two billion five billion dlrs annually year .
The growing opportunity make money space highlighted month U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration seek lucrative commercial bid lauch future weather satellite , ending long-standing dependence National Aeronautics Space Administration .
Companies country established satellite launching operation may also get jump eventually providing space-based service , particularly proposed international manned space station launched planned early 1990s .
The 12 billion dlr space station , first proposed President Reagan 1984 , could require many 16 cargo delivery year , many delivered private firm .
The partner space station currently slated Canada , Japan , 13-nation European Space Agency , latter two also developing commercial space program .
Until Challenger explosion January 1986 , NASA virtual lock world 's commercial space cargo .
But re-evaluation shuttle program , President Reagan declared last August future U.S. shuttle flight longer carry commercial payload .
The administration 's decision left Arianespace , French-led European consortium , option available satellite owner concern quickly sold planned flight 1989 .
The company also raised price , 30,000 dlrs launch 50,000 dlrs , even larger price tag dampen demand .
Arianespace sighned 18 new contract last year , compared 11 1985 .
Those kind tariff caused even non-capitalist country try get piece action .
China , Soviet Union Japan announced satellite launch program several U.S. firm , including McDonnell Douglas Corp , General Dynamics Corp Martin Marietta promised spend mlns dollar next three year develop satellite launch capability .
There tremendous pent-up demand satellite launch , analyst said .
Without Challenger , three satellite launch last year , 15 fewer 1985 lowest since 1980 , two sent .
Ariane expects launch six eight satellite year next three year , 75 pct world's satellite launch period .
McDonnell Douglas scored biggest coup U.S. firm January 734 mln dlr U.S. Air Force pact 20 unmanned rocket launch military satellite .
The contract expected underwrite company 's effort build rocket private satellite launch .
Martin Marietta , however , first U.S. company sign client , Federal Express Co. Marietta plan launch ExpressStar communication satellite 1989 .
Marietta said also build version Titan rocket used Air Force private company want get satellite launch buisiness .
Arianespace director Charles Bigot said U.S. company probably become European firm 's biggest competitor satellite launching .
He expect national space program become commercially viable late 1990s .
Japan expanded space program , launching 38 government-owned satellite last 16 year .
But small February launched first satellite circle earth pole .
Japan also yet design build rocket .
The satellite launched February placed orbit McDonnell Douglas-designed Delta rocket assembled Japanese license .
Tsugo Tadakawa , director Washington office Japan 's National Space Development Agency ( NASDA ) , said Japan plan launch seven H-1 rocket , American Japanese hybrid replaces Delta , 1991 .
Its much larger sucessor , H-II , ready 1992 , said .
NASDA 's annual budget 800 mln dlrs , Tadakawa said , 10 pct size NASA 's yearly spending .
Still , NASDA free private competition home full support government , since aerospace chosen Ministry Trade Information one country 's new industry next decade .
Surprisingly , People 's Republic China , relative newcomer aerospace , far successful competitor Ariane .
The country 's Great Wall Industry Corp national program besides European consortium win private satellite contract .
It launch Westar communication satellite New-York based Terasat 1988 .
