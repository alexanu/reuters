Despite failure monsoon rain recent year , possible maintain higher foodgrain production , signifying growing resilience agricultural sector , report said .
The strategy increasing irrigation potential along greater use high yielding seed varieites improvement fertiliser efficiency yielding result , said , adding total foodgrain output 1985/86 , 1984/85 1983/84 respectively 150.5 mln tonne , 145.5 mln record 152.4 mln .
India targeted produce 178 183 mln tonne foodgrains last year seventh five-year development plan ending March 31 , 1990 .
Taking midpoint 180 mln tonne target 1986/87 estimated production around 151 mln tonne , gap 29 mln tonne made remaining three year plan increasing grain output annually nine mln tonne .
But target achieved good weather , report said .
`` The major thrust programme , therefore , better water ( irrigation ) management .
Simultaneously , effort spread improved technology including timely use input ( farm material like fertiliser ) adequate quantity vigrously pursued , '' said .
