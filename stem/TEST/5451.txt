An announcement Alliant Computer Systems Inc & lt ; ALNT > new low-end near-supercomputer & lt ; ETA Systems Inc > 's unveiling high-end machine category show competition stiff market , industry analyst said .
Consultants said Alliant 's new FX computer , aimed mainly scientist researcher priced 100,000 200,000 dlrs faster anything else price range .
But said Alliant trying bring price line discount give many customer .
`` ( The new FX ) significant extent represents Alliant 's recognition reality marketplace , '' said source briefed Alliant new computer .
`` The list price line seeing anyway .
'' Near-supercomputers , often called mini-supercomputers , resemble massive supercomputer favoured scientist much le expensive quarter powerful .
Supercomputers cost well one mln dlrs mini-supercomputers generally priced 200,000 dlrs one mln dlrs .
Most near-supercomputers use new computer architecture called parallel processing , problem broken segment segment assigned different processor .
General-purpose mainframe computer one processor work one segment problem time , making slow complex scientific problem .
Near-supercomputers existence five year two leading manufacturer , Alliant Convex Computer Corp ( CNVX ) , held two successful initial public offering last year .
But Alliant Convex , Texas company , also facing 15 company competing 200 250 mln dlrs sale year , result lower price shrinking profit margin .
Heavy discounting , slow acceptance outside scientific market , lack software many competitor also made analyst reassess prospect near-supercomputers .
Jeffrey Canin , computer analyst Hambrecht Quist , said added year original growth estimate industry .
He expects sale reach 1.1 billion dlrs 1991 , instead 1990 .
In recent week Alliant Convex said third quarter earnings would reduced `` competitive pricing pressure .
'' Alliant said profit period five cent share eight cent last year , although revenue period rose 14.2 mln dlrs 8.6 mln .
Convex said third quarter earnings le second quarter 's 12 cent share revenue rise almost eight mln dlrs 1986 third quarter 18 18.5 mln dlrs .
Until , price discounting occurred bottom product line near-supercomputers , ETA System 's announcement could start squeezing Convex Alliant top , analyst said .
ETA , subsidiary Control Data Corp & lt ; CDC > , introduced two machine really full-blown supercomputer similar sold Cray Research Inc , world 's biggest supercomputer maker , half price Cray 's cheapest model .
The ETA-10 Model P cost 995,000 dlrs Model Q 1.2 mln dlrs .
ETA official told news conference new machine may classified supercomputer aimed directly upper end product line Alliant Convex .
Acceptance ETA 's product could hampered lack software , analyst said , noting issue face parallel processor maker degree .
Because parallel processing new architecture yet widely used , third party software vendor slow write program near-supercomputers .
ETA , however , `` offer low priced entry supercomputer customer , '' one consultant said .
Canin cautioned `` price pressure continue time '' estimated five percentage point knocked gross profit margin Convex Alliant year price discounting .
Next year , said , two company face new set problem introduce second generation product .
`` I always cautious first major product transition .
