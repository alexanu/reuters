`` It 's case company paying thing different environment Defense Department would paid , '' said Howard Mager Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp .
In recent year , Defense Department , DOD , increased competitive bidding weapon contract asked contractor pay cost developing weapon program .
The move helped cut waste abuse contractor also dictated firm assume much risk , analyst said .
`` It 's stricter environment , '' said Anthony Hatch Argus Research Corp. `` Contractors absorbing cost risk 's likely trend time come .
'' The trend probably lead writeoffs , analyst said .
Programs prone , agreed , Advanced Tactical Fighter , ATF , new generation , high-technology fighter plane developed U.S. Air Force , C-17 air transport plane Light Helicopter Experimental , LHX , development Army .
Other program may also affected , said .

Two team contractor competing contract develop prototype ATF .

McDonnell Douglas 's Douglas Aircraft Co working two test plane , production award 210 aircraft made late 1989 , Douglas Aircraft spokesman said .
Under government 's new procedure , contractor spend hundred million dollar development typically recoup investment production .
But government sometimes award production second contractor develop system .
General Electric Co & lt ; GE > , example , developed F404 engine Navy .
But two week ago , Pentagon awarded 30 pct F404 production United Technologies ' Pratt Whitney .
Such tactic increased competition government risk decimating industry making competitive , said Michael LaTronica Redding Research Group .
`` Two year ago , defense contractor worst enemy .
They cost efficient , '' LaTronica said .
`` Now DOD allowed situation swing far back way may danger losing defense industry national resource .
'' While nation whole posted trade deficit recent year , aerospace defense exported product imported , noted .
LaTronica others said , however , change government procurement may coming .
`` I hear Pentagon looking situation , '' said John Diamantis , defense analyst Pershing Co .
He said small defense electronics firm believe Pentagon begin re-evaluating procurement policy perhaps start paying development money .
Redding Research 's LaTronica , still like industry despite probability additional unforeseen writeoffs , said , `` There 's swing sentiment .
The defense bashing psychology last year starting shift .
'' LaTronica noted one government official recently suggested winner ATF prototype award get sole production plane specified time .
The investment large .
The Lockheed , General Dynamics , Boeing ATF team , example , spending 691 mln dlrs develop prototype .
The danger Pentagon run change made company hesitate bid develop program instead wait second source production award .
`` But may take company going bust really change people 's thinking , '' LaTronica said .
