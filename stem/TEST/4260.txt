East West Monday decided go ahead ambitious nuclear fusion project billed possibly providing inexhaustible source energy , International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said .
Representatives U.S. , The Soviet Union , European Community Japan agreed develop plan revolutionary thermonuclear reactor , produce energy splitting atom today 's nuclear plant , joining .
Work due begin next year Institute Plasma Physics Max Planck Foundation near Munich , West Germany , scheduled completion 1990 , IAEA statement said .
Research fusion 's scientific feasibility way many year project approved Monday , known International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) study actual plant could built .
The project represents unprecedented display East-West scientific cooperation , decision made completion whether actual reactor would jointly constructed individual participant country .
Dieter Sigmar , leading U.S. Fusion researcher , said last month development demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs need least another 10 year .
Fusion plant would produce little radioactive waste .
While today 's nuclear power plant need uranium , mined country producing dangerous waste , fusion plant would eventually run deuterium , element related hydrogen available almost limitless supply sea water , according expert .
