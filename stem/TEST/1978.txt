U.S. banking data released today distorted draw sweeping conclusion monetary policy , support market 's assumption Federal Reserve started tighten grip credit , economist said .
`` It 's clear Fed firmed somewhat .
Discount window borrowing , net free reserve , Fed fund rate average pattern reserve addition consistent modest tightening , '' said Dana Johnson First Chicago Corp. Johnson , several economist , estimate Fed fund rate trade 6-1/4 6-3/8 pct .
Discount window borrowing week Wednesday 935 mln dlrs day , producing daily average two-week statement period 689 mln dlrs , highest since week December 31 , 1986 , 393 mln dlrs previously .
Moreover , bank forced borrow huge 5.2 billion dlrs Fed Wednesday - highest daily total year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balance Fed day left bank two billion dlrs reserve Fed anticipated .

As bank ' checking-account liability rise , reserve required hold deposit Fed .
Required reserve indeed rise sharply 2.5 billion dlrs day two week ended Wednesday , economist said Fed may believed magnitude projected M-1 surge late week started add reserve late .
Second , apparent shortage Treasury bill apparently left Wall Street dealer little collateral enagage repurchase agreement Fed , economist said .
Thus , although 10.3 billion dlrs repos outstanding Wednesday night , Fed may wanted add even reserve prevented .
`` It 's inconceivable Fed n't add much wanted shortage collateral , '' said Ward McCarthy Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated Fed targetting discount-window borrowing 400 mln dlrs day , equivalent Fed fund rate around 6-3/8 pct .
After citing reason Fed probably tightened credit degree suggested data , economist said fact Fed delayed arranging overnight injection reserve last day statement period good sign restrictive policy .

But reviewing today's figure , said , `` It 's fair say Fed may moving toward slightly le accommodative reserve posture .
'' Leeds expects Fed fund trade 6-1/4 6-3/8 pct said Fed unlikely raise discount rate unless dollar 's fall gather pace .
Johnson First Chicago agreed , citing political opposition Washington dollar-defense package time Congress see dollar depreciation key reducing U.S. trade surplus Japan .
