The Bundesbank unlikely change credit policy central bank council meet Thursday last session Venice summit , banking economist money market dealer said .
The Bundesbank steered money market rate lower last month cutting rate security repurchase pact , unlikely cap move cut leading interest rate near future , said .
The council meet Saarbruecken , meeting followed news conference around 1030 GMT .
But Bundesbank official noted news conference usually called council meet outside Frankfurt , necessarily herald policy move .
Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today reason cut interest rate money supply growth shown sign slowing May dollar stable mark .
Schlesinger told Reuters Tokyo , Bundesbank opened representative office , West German economy picking contracting seasonally adjusted 1/2 one pct first quarter .
Money market dealer said call money likely hold 3.50/70 pct range month , Bundesbank switched last month tender interest rate minimum bid rate 3.50 pct , allocating fund 3.55 pct .
`` They set signal indicated could maybe lower market rate even , discount Lombard , '' Winfried Hutmann , chief economist Schroeder , Munchmeyer , Hengst Investment GmbH said .
Werner Chrobok , managing partner Bethmann Bank , said German rate among lowest industrial country around historical low West Germany .
A cut rate would little impact economy bank case reporting slack credit demand , company swimming liquidity , Chrobok said .
The Bundesbank would therefore reluctant make move interest rate , would better held reserve .
`` The Bundesbank frightened using powder , '' said .
A cut discount Lombard rate , bring line new structure money market rate since last month , would little practical significance , dealer said .
The Bundesbank could therefore act wanted diplomatic gesture next week 's Venice summit .
But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl often made clear past opposes gesture mere `` eyewash .
'' Economists said really Bonn government cut tax , rather Bundesbank ease monetary policy , meet pressure West Germany Venice summit .
But Bonn struggling finance already announced tax cut falling tax revenue widening federal budget deficit , hard see Bonn could cut tax .
`` The Bonn government weak position Venice ca n't risk increasing deficit , '' said Schroeder , Muenchmeyer , Hengst 's Hutmann .
Bethmann 's Chrobok said anything happen Venice , must fiscal rather monetary policy .
`` But I n't expect convincing measure , '' said .
Money market dealer noted call money continued normalize today , falling 3.60/70 pct 3.75/85 yesterday much five pct Friday pushed month-end distortion .
Call money could come upwards pressure later month major round tax payment bank behalf customer , starting week beginning June 15 .
Two public holiday week could also distort market .
Dealers said expected Bundesbank allocate fund tomorrow latest repurchase pact unchanged 3.55 pct , setting unchanged minimum bid rate 3.50 pct , fully replace 5.5 billion mark outgoing pact .
But dealer said possible Bundesbank would allocate fund 3.6 pct rather 3.55 .
That would represent tightening policy , however .
Because Bundesbank scale bid allocates minimum accepted rate , bank may try get full allocation bidding heavily 3.6 pct , dealer said .
On another issue , Poehl said Bundesbank likely lift restriction private use European Currency Unit ( ECU ) one meeting soon .
Saarbruecken would suitable place announcement gesture European unity , capital Saarland bordering France , twice French occupation century .
But dealer said ECU announcement unlikely come week , number technical legal matter still resolved , instance German ECU account would treated minimum reserve purpose .
