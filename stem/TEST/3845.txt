In fast paced personal computer industry , million made six month , opportunity may exist company seeking capitalize delay new IBM software standard .
When International Business Machines Corp & lt ; IBM > announced new generation personal computer , PS/2 family , April , also decided establish new operating system machine , death sentence billion dollar software use existing system .
Because IBM world 's largest computer company - 70 pct world 's computer bear IBM logo - industry analyst , even IBM 's competitor , expect within two year new operating system , called OS/2 , commonplace current standard , MS-DOS , .
`` By 1989 , least one half 60 pct personal computer sold OS/2 , '' predicted George Colony , president consulting firm Forrester Research Inc .
But opportunity , analyst said , firm selling advanced version MS-DOS , specialised multi-tasking software package Unix , alternative MS-DOS developed American Telephone Telegraph Co & lt ; T > developed following among engineer federal government .
OS-2 , IBM developing Microsoft Corp , author MS-DOS , ready another six month .
IBM said last week product schedule analyst software developer skeptical , since delay major new software product commonplace .
Initial acceptance new system likely hindered disgruntlement hardware software vendor alike , would prefer keep making product work tried true MS-DOS , according Paul Cubbage , software analyst market research firm Dataquest Inc. Compaq , IBM 's major personal computer competitor , already said stick MS-DOS standard .
Compaq president Rod Canion said recently `` automatic mass migration '' OS/2 .
`` ( Advanced MS-DOS ) application continue meet far broader set user need OS/2 supply long becomes available , '' said .
Cubbage acknowledged `` probably year really useful application available OS-2 , '' creating opportunity multi-tasking program .
`` But come time memory limit get , '' said .
IBM 's new operating system big event computer industry PS-2 announcement .
The new computer , powerful use Intel Corp's fast 80386 microprocessor , expected rejuvenate sagging sale personal computer industry already gave big boost IBM .
Company official said last week 250,000 PS/2s shipped 2-1/2 month since introduction IBM expect record pc sale th year result .
The enthusiasm PS-2 particularly striking since full potential powerful computer tapped new operating system high level software available , analyst said .
OS-2 allow user work many different program , task , personal computer , ideally without slowdown operation , capability industry long strived .
Microsoft already promising alternative OS-2 , particular advanced version Windows multitasking program , used conjunction MS-DOS .
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates suggested advanced version program , Windows 386 , announced September available six eight week later , price 100 dlrs 300 dlrs .
OS/2 expected cost 325 dlrs .
Some software developer said program , designed 80386-based personal computer , may even superior OS/2 allowing user multitask application without disruption .
But several analyst commented user really want multi-taksing operating system 80386-based personal computer , far desire met primarily small Atlanta software publisher , The Software Link Inc .
In late spring company announced PC-MOS/386 , multi-tasking , multiuser operating system compatible MS/DOS work 80386-based computer .
The company said filled 2,500 order first four week availability expects shipment reach 40,000 year end .
International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unix could promising alternative OS/2 , even IVM system available .
IBM endorse Unix PS/2 model , although say would announce version Advanced Interactive Executive ( AIX ) , Unix compatible operating system .
But federal government requires Unix compatability computer contract , almost certain company provide Unix-style operating system IBM system .
ATT two week ago introduced version Unix compatible 80386 microprocessor , although IBM's computer specifically .
Analysts saw announcement move get Unix accepted strong alternative OS/2 IBM system chance take .
