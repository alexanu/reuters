The Semiconductor Industry Association put three-month average book-to-bill ratio 1.21 , analyst ' expectation reflects sixth straight increase indicator computer industry activity .
Average booking three month period ended March totaled 910.8 mln dlrs , 15.6 pct month ago highest booking since September , 1984 .
March billing , computer chip sale month , totaled 912.1 mln dlrs , 34.6 pct month ago , association said .
The three month average billing totaled 751.3 mln dlrs , 6.5 pct .
March billing strongest recorded since November , 1984 , association said .

Preliminary total solid state shipment first quarter 1987 totaled 2.25 billion dlrs , 4.9 pct last quarter 15.9 pct last year 's first quarter .
Semiconductor Industry Association President Andrew Procassini said rise book bill due substantial increase U.S. booking March .
`` We believe booking increase reflects growing confidence electronic equipment manufacturer end-equipment market segment improved substantially first quarter , '' Procassini said statement .
The association also revised book-to-bill ratio estimate three month ended February 1.12 , 1.13 earlier .
It revised January book-to-bill figure 1.09 1.12 estimated earlier .

The association break March order three-month average , put 910.8 mln dlrs .
Gumport noted three-month average booking well 800-865 mln dlrs anticipated industry .
He said semiconductor stock could rise five ten pct stock market open tomorrow , due positive number .
`` Skeptics going pretty strong reason like group ( stock ) , '' Gumport said .
Kidder Peabody Co analyst Michael Kubiak said ratio indicates March order one billion dlrs , would highest monthly order rate since April , 1984 .
He predicted least five pct rise semiconductor stock open , said stock group could soar high 15 pct session .
`` One month boom-time make , good news , '' said .
Kubiak attributed stong semiconductor order strength personal computer market , inventory restocking strong buying distributor .
Purchasing manager keeping computer chip inventory low , due overcapacity industry slow growth economy general , analyst noted .
The semiconductor industry slump past three year .
The analyst said March order sale number strongest evidence yet trend may turning .
Nevertheless , expect Administration retreat proposed sanction Japanese chip maker .
They added , however , industry continues improve , could mean sanction short term .
Jack Beedle , President In-Stat , electronics industry research firm , called March number `` excellent '' , also cautioned excessive optimism .
`` I still believe caution word , rather euphoria , '' said Beedle , adding yet see strong indication general economy computer industry support solid , long-term recovery .
Beedle said think semiconductor industry good second quarter , still think positive shift export industrial production needed sustain recovery .
