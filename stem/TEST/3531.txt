GTE Corp scientist said discoverd much simpler method producing transistor creating entirely new electronic material .
The new method , said , consists simultaneously '' growing '' metal connection silicon crystal together form one , three dimensional device connection penetrating entire device .
Conventional transistor require many step make connection surface .
GTE Laboratories created `` entirely new electronic material device form , may open spectrum us even imagined time , '' said David Decker , vice president director research GTE Laboratories .
`` Although still early research , obviously excited found significantly simpler , believe , cheaper way produce electronic device , '' said .
Researchers GTE created new transistor combining heating silicon conductive metal , tantalum disilicide , two grow together .
The resulting device microscopic metal rod extending througout chip , creating three dimensional transistor superior standard devics high power application , scientist said .
They said , connection extend vertically througout new device , much greater volume active material conventional surface-mounted connection .
Decker said scientist still early stage research device , prototype new device compare favorably conventionaly made transistor show promise superior performance .
He said prototype device also proved particularly efficient detecting light , could open new possibility solar energy conversion , development electronic camera greater efficiency optical communication system .
