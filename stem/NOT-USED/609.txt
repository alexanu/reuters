Nippon Mining Co Ltd president Yukio Kasahara said state-owned Japanese firm hoped find additional joint venture partner explore U.S. oil reserve .
`` We secure stability oil Japan , '' Kasahara told reporter World Petroleum Congress .
`` In exploration area I think Japanese company interested joint venture .
'' Nippon Mining , example , last September signed agreement Dupont Co 's & lt ; DD > Conoco Inc participate 135 mln dlr exploration venture includes six well land 14 offshore Louisiana .
The first joint well drilled Gulf Mexico 's Green Canyon Block 182 , deepwater lease Conoco almost forced return federal government undrilled low oil price .
`` At moment success proceed Conoco .
Maybe end year find oil , '' Kasahara said .
He said similar kind joint venture '' would best '' Nippon Mining 's oil exploration effort future .
Kasahara also said Nippon Mining planning acquire U.S. refining marketing outlet .
`` Retail sale general interest Japanese oil company , '' said .
When asked whether believed world oil price might strengthen later year , Kasahara said expected price hold steady today 's level .
`` Within year I think 18 dlrs barrel continue .
But next year I n't know , '' said .
`` For refining business , stability important .
Whether price 18 dlrs 20 dlrs , n't care .
'' But encouraging additional upstream effort may require modestly higher oil price , Kasahara added .
`` For exploration I think 20 dlrs barrel 22 dlrs barrel would reasonable , '' said .
The key factor determining whether Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) would raise 18 dlr barrel benchmark price ongoing war Iran Iraq , Kasahara said .
Saudi Arabia , added , uncertain element OPEC equation need maintain revenue time weakened U.S. dollar reduced oil profit .
Nippon Mining , like Japanese crude buyer benefitting drop value dollar , favor continuing price OPEC crude oil according U.S. currency regardless dollar-yen relationship , Kasahara said .
`` I hope dollar would strengthen eventually continue improve .
I would prefer see ( OPEC ) pricing remain dollar , '' said .
