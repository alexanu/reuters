A Soviet geologist said scientist need coordinate data onshore offshore oil deposit help identify global formation would indicate potential discovery oil gas reserve .
Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich , head petroleum geology Moscow State University , told delegate World Petroleum Congress exploration efficiency could also improved new sophisticated technology .
`` We emphasize data petroleum distribution onshore offshore , possible clarify idea global regularity oil gas prospect , '' Semenovich said .
`` However , much work done coordinate data concerning structure oil gas prospect adjoining onshore offshore basin .
'' Sharing information could help geologist better predict regional trend underground formation indicate presence oil gas , said .
Semenovich also said existing estimate potential oil natural gas resource world may need revised upward oil company continue examine unexplored region .
The world , already produced 476 billion barrel oil gas , current total 733 billion barrel proved reserve .
Undiscovered resource estimated 1.4 trillion barrel , half total ultimate reserve , Semenovich said .
`` There lot unstudied region world , far already known basin , one continues find additional reserve , '' said , noting Antarctica virtually ignored .
`` The existing estimate potential resource world may need enlarged .
'' To find deeper expensive reserve , scientist need use 3-D mapping underground formation laser spectrometry measure bitumen soil plant among technique , said .
He estimated continental slope contain 10 13 pct offshore reserve .
Semenovich also said virtually total oil gas resource estimated exist world would discovered placed production next 50 year .
After speech , Semenovich told Reuters Soviet oil production increasing .
`` The difficulty 1985 overcome 're back normal production , '' said .
The Soviet Union , world 's largest producer oil , experienced drilling technical problem cut total liquid production 12.45 mln barrel day 1984 12.1 mln barrel day 1985 .
Last year , Soviets produced estimated 12.3 mln barrel .
When asked recent reopening testing coal gasification project Soviet Central Asia , Semenovich said project important lack oil reserve region .
Semenovich declined identify level world oil price coal gasification process would become economic .
`` It 's expensive time , '' Semenovich said .
`` Theoretical development underway test run .
For moment , coal gasification small part energy industry , '' said .
