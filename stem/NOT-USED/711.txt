Next year likely see shortfall zinc concentrate 100,000 tonne , although ample supply 1987 , Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd metal analyst Stephen Briggs said .
Speaking second day Metal Bulletin 's base metal conference , Briggs said major factor predicted 100,000 tonne shortfall zinc concentrate supply 1988 imminent cessation new mining termination milling Pine Point Canada .
However , could partially offset stockpile .
Nevertheless , despite predicted shortfall unlikely dramatic change treatment charge 1988 .
The picture 1987 , hand , one record production zinc metal fewer strike anticipated Canada , improvement South America new capacity South Korea .
`` Dramatic new record level concentrate output also expected 1987 , '' Briggs said .
This would partly due return normal level existing mine Australia Peru , allied achievement full capacity 170,000 tonne year Faro Canada .
Looking forward , major event probable opening 1991 Red Dog mine Alaska capacity 300,000 tonne concentrate year .
`` Once mine fully stream unlikely major shortage concentrate early 1990s , '' added .
The picture lead also closely allied zinc , new dedicated lead mine planned therefore supply concentrate largely dependent by-product zinc mine .
`` On basis , calculation point modest oversupply lead concentrate 1987 , '' Briggs said .
The copper forecast , however , record non-Socialist output 6.6 mln tonne concentrate 1987 , increasing 150,000 tonne 1988 .
Production primary refined copper metal would also increase , much concentrate output , leading moderate oversupply concentrate 150,000 tonne year shortage predicted rest decade , said .
