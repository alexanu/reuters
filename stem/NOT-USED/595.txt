The oil price collapse 1986 put development vast petroleum resource -- heavy extra heavy oil -- hold .
But oil price increase long-term economic outlook favorable , oil industry expert said .
`` Estimated potential world reserve extra heavy oil exceed 500 billion barrel , half located Venezuela , '' Juan Chacin Guzman , President Petroleos de Venezuela told World Petroleum Congress .
`` And virtually unused resource represents prime example need invest technology ensure tomorrow 's energy future , '' added .
Venezuela reduce heavy crude oil output favor light oil economics limited market .
Not many refinery upgraded process heavy oil .
`` Improved technology potential reducing capital investment operating cost typical heavy oil development project 30 pct , '' Gordon Willmon , VP general manager , oil sand coal department , Esso Resources Canada Ltd said World Petroleum Congress .
Crude oil price fell 10 dlrs dlrs barrel last summer OPEC member increased production gain market share , since risen around 18 dlrs OPEC production/pricing agreement basically tact .
Willmon said light medium crude oil currently supply 90 pct world oil demand yet account le 25 pct remaining petroleum resource .
`` So future demand increasingly met various form heavy oil , '' Willmon said .
Heavy crude oil resource include extra-heavy oil/tar sand , natural bituminous sand oil shale ( sedimentary rock ) .
Willmon cited major factor make heavy oil development economical , including real stable growth crude oil price , favorable fiscal term , improved technology .
He said expects `` piece puzzle fit together .
'' But cautioned short-term outlook sensitive crude oil price .
And said important factor development heavy oil recovery price crude .
Willmon said price light crude must eight dlrs higher heavy crude incentive oil company upgrade refinery process heavy oil .
He said current price differential five dlrs barrel .
Willmon indicated benchmark crude oil price 20 dlrs would ideal .
But said currently study broad range high potential cost-effective technology resource recovery , transportation upgrading heavy oil , would permit commercial development despite lower crude oil price outlook .
Willmon said technology included enhanced recovery steam injection oil-and-water emulsion reduce viscocity heavy oil flow easily pipeline .
He said technology may substantially reduce current captial investment operating cost .
But emphasized innovative technology alone may encourage new investment , oil price need show meaningful sustained recovery .
Most expense associated heavy oil production fixed operating cost oil sand project , rather exploration , according Robert Smith , Senior VP Operations & lt ; Syncrude Canada Ltd > .
While exploration cost conventional crude oil range four nine dlrs barrel , discovery cost synthetic crude oil sand nearly zero location nature deposit known , according Smith .
But remote location oil sand deposit mean everything required build operate plant must come outside area .
Willmon also said , `` Public policy could best help providing financial support offset high cost technology developmemt would help generate project could survive even low oil price extended period time .
'' U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said , `` The Reagan Administration firmly committed , without equivocation , continuing effort improve condition incentive marketplace spur oil gas exploration development .
