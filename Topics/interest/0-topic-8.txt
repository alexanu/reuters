<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 350 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 350 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 525 mln stg while bankers' balnces below target will take
out around 175 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
and a fall in note circulation will add some 300 mln stg and 40
mln stg to the system respectively.
